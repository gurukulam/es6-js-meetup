## Practical ES6

This repo is the base for my talk at Bangalore JS Meetup on 18th Feb 2017.
It contains of two applications both of which have an identical output that looks like the front-page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) website.

__Contents__

  - ES5 Hacker News

    This is an implementation that is completely written using ES5.

  - ES2015 Hacker News
  
    This implementation is written using ES2015.

The talk will comprise of me handcoding the changes required to convert the first implementation to the second one.
In this manner we will learn how to practically benefit from ES2015 features like
  - let/const and Block scoping
  - Fat Arrow function notation
  - Destructuring, Spread operators
  - String and Object literals
  - Promises
  - ES6 modules
  - ES6 classes
  - Object.assign

We will touch upon other features such as Symbols, Proxies Maps, Sets, Iterators and Generators.
I have not found extensive usage of these features in my day to day development and also as they require very involved explanations will not demo them.

### Instructions to run the applications

For both of the applications, the below instructions should get you up and running quickly

```
git clone https://github.com/kalcifer/es6-js-meetup.git
cd es5-hacker-news
npm install
npm run build
```
This is not a hands-on session, but more of a live one. I will not be able to help you with any setup problems during the talk. However I will gladly be of assistance after/before the session.

__Any feedback is welcome!__
